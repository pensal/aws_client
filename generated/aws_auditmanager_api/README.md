*About the service:*
Welcome to the AWS Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers
who need detailed information about the AWS Audit Manager API operations,
data types, and errors.

AWS Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection
so that you can continuously audit your AWS usage, and assess the
effectiveness of your controls to better manage risk and simplify
compliance.

AWS Audit Manager provides pre-built frameworks that structure and automate
assessments for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a pre-built
collection of controls with descriptions and testing procedures, which are
grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard
or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support
internal audits with unique requirements.
