# AWS API client for AWS IoT Core Device Advisor

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
AWS IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capability
for validating IoT devices during device software development. Device
Advisor provides pre-built tests that you can use to validate IoT devices
for reliable and secure connectivity with AWS IoT Core before deploying
devices to production. By using Device Advisor, you can confirm that your
devices can connect to AWS IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if
applicable, receive software updates from IoT Device Management. You can
also download signed qualification reports to submit to the AWS Partner
Network to get your device qualified for the AWS Partner Device Catalog
without the need to send your device in and wait for it to be tested.
