# AWS API client for Amazon DevOps Guru

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify
anomalous behavior in business critical operational applications. You
specify the AWS resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the
Amazon CloudWatch metrics and AWS CloudTrail events related to those
resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru
creates an <i>insight</i> that includes recommendations, related events, and
related metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For
more information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What
is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>.

You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are
notified every time a new insight is created. You can also enable DevOps
Guru to generate an OpsItem in AWS Systems Manager for each insight to help
you manage and track your work addressing insights.
