**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This is the Amazon Lookout for Vision API Reference. It provides
descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors.

Amazon Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects in industrial
products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify
missing components in an industrial product, damage to vehicles or
structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects
in silicon wafers â€” or any other physical item where quality is important
such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit boards.
