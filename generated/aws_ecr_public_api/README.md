# AWS API client for Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image
registry service. Amazon ECR provides both public and private registries to
host your container images. You can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their
preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a
secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container
Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this
API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see
<a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
Elastic Container Registry API Reference</a>.
