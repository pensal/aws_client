# AWS API client for Amazon Macie 2

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that
uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your
sensitive data in AWS. Macie automates the discovery of sensitive data, such
as PII and intellectual property, to provide you with insight into the data
that your organization stores in AWS. Macie also provides an inventory of
your Amazon S3 buckets, which it continually monitors for you. If Macie
detects sensitive data or potential data access issues, it generates
detailed findings for you to review and act upon as necessary.
