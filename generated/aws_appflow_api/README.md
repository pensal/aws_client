Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for developers

types, and errors.

Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to
securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applications
like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like
Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and
include applicable OAuth attributes (such as <code>auth-code</code> and
<code>redirecturi</code>) with the connector-specific
<code>ConnectorProfileProperties</code> when creating a new connector
profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For example, Salesforce users
can refer to the <a

<i>Authorize Apps with OAuth</i> </a> documentation.
