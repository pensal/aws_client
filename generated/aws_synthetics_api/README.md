# AWS API client for Synthetics

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your
services. You can create and manage <i>canaries</i>, which are modular,
lightweight scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the
outside-in. You can set up your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per
minute. The canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web
services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data,
screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate
with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted nodes
in your applications. For more information, see <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html">Using
ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon
CloudWatch User Guide</i>.
